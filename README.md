A Telegram Bot is a program that behaves like a normal chat partner with additional functions. It performs predefined tasks independently and without the user’s involvement. Automatically or on request, it can send you the following information:

Text messages
Images
Videos
Files of any other kind

An important function of a Telegram bot is the possibility to execute commands in a Telegram chat, which then directly trigger actions or request information. For example, it is possible to send the bot the command “/help” or “/help”, which then outputs the commands possible for this bot in the chat as text feedback. This could be the following command list:

/status
/temperature
/last alarm
/stop
